            <h2>Who Mann Patel really is?</h2>
            <p>
                A few days ago, while doing my investigation on different business geniuses across the world, I somehow got drowned in all of the excess information from Facebook, LinkedIn and many other social media platforms. And from God knows what thought, I took a deep dive on X (widely known as Twitter, obviously :) ). I’ve gone there to see what braindead and amusing posts I could find (for relaxation), sometimes you need to take a happy adventure to see what outrageous things can come out of some people. There I found him, and I thought to myself…<br><br>
                <blockquote>
                    <em>Who is this young Gentleman, and why the title of his post stated that he won a God Damn Hackathon, all by himself…</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>I entered his post and I analyzed it deeply, being bombarded with questions like:</p>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><h3>How one can achieve such a feat?</h3></li>
                <li><h3>Is this Real?</h3></li>
                <li><h3>What is his age?</h3></li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Either way, after looking through his profile I realized
                <blockquote>
                    <em>He is him, the one that I'm looking for!!</em>
                </blockquote>
                <p>So let me introduce this amazing young man to you, <strong>Mann Patel</strong> is a 21 years old Software engineer and a UI/UX designer and a member, more to say a captain of the international AI development team 'Bezos.backward' which secured National Rank 17 amongst 10,000+ registered participants in the Amazon Machine Learning Challenge. He also worked and studied at Google in Los Angeles, they call them “nooglers”.</p>
            </p>
            <p>
                I know. How many people’s dreams are based on working and being part of the Google team, but Mann already was at crazy age, him being 18, exactly after he finished his studies in Computer Science and Engineering at “Devang Patel University” in India. Now he studies for his Master at University of Southern California.
            </p>
            <p>
                And in one of his earliest roles, Mann served as a machine learning researcher at his institute. There, he built a deepfake tweet generator that mimicked a user’s writing style based on their past tweets. He experimented with GPT-2 and RoBERTa-based models, comparing fine-tuned and custom-trained variants using the Giant Language Model Test Room (GLTR). The models achieved fooling rates of 61% (GPT-2) and 53% (custom), providing insight into adversarial generation and language manipulation.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>Man… those Indians are something else right?</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                And that is not it. Remember what I said about him winning the hackathon alone? He went to one of the biggest Hackathons there were in that period, and I’m talking about HackSC 2024 where Mann took first place in the Artists Track with his project FontSearch. He tackled a real-world problem and turned it into something impressive enough to stand out in a competitive field.
            </p>
            <p>
                His project, "font_search," is a semantic search engine designed to transform the way fonts are found and created. By simply describing the desired style or mood in natural language, users can find matching fonts or even generate entirely new ones. The system bridges creative intent with computational design.
            </p>
            <h3>The development journey began with a key challenge:</h3>
            <p>
                The lack of an accessible, detailed font dataset. To overcome this, Mann scraped thousands of free fonts from dafonts.com and wrote a Python script to render over 13,000 fonts into images containing the phrase “The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,” alongside all alphanumeric characters. These images were processed using the Google Gemini Flash model, which generated structured semantic data for each font. Each font was annotated with fields such as: detailed description, personality, practical use, cultural intuition, and search keywords forming the core document base for the engine.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>I need one of those apps for my articles too :0</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                If you are surprised then imagine how I was when I found out that Mann is a CEO too. Despite a focus-be-damned realm of entrepreneurship, be sure to be amazed by Patel’s companies and start-ups, Sylzo, and Swirple, which he co-founded and he has a huge portfolio for AI and web design as well. His business pyramid, which values "efficiency over tradition", is not a mere idea but a personal philosophy that compels him to upend convention and produce solutions at such a rapid pace, of such high quality, and such unexpected inventiveness.
            </p>
            <p>
                Getting back to his projects beginning with the small and unrevealed one.
            </p>
            <h3>That is Syzlo.</h3>
            <p>
                The idea of "Artificial Creative Intelligence" that Sylzo embodies, while wondering in "The Creativity Expansion Constant", embodies a deep belief in AI as a force of augmentation more than one of substitution. He also has plans of publishing it and along with all his work to the marketplace, for his magnificent work he could get up to what? 20K-50K $ just for his Violence detection AI which applies sophisticated CNN-LSTM architectures to real-world safety challenges that could be implemented in Schools, Shops and basically every public area, getting rid of the problem of incapability or negligence of a security guard.
            </p>
            <p>Then we get to his bigger project:</p>
            <h3>Swirl</h3>
            <p>
                Swirl is the project Mann is the most proud of, as his first EdTech start-up who boomed and now is accessed by many who want to learn more about programming. He’s getting a big revenue via the swirl program upping his network at over 100k easily.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>Swirl the program that teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console! —Mann Patel</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Along with the online programs Mann works hard in the field developing robots as a hobby. He was one of the main developers at “RoboNLP” the next generation of intelligent interactive systems, working for the army in 2019 where he helped develop a machine learning ensemble to classify news articles with 99.6% accuracy using K10 cross-validation. Their system applied NLP methods to monitor, extract patterns, and derive insights from online news, assisting in surveillance and threat assessment tasks. His work earned him a letter of recommendation from the Head of the AI center.

            <blockquote>
                <em>Isn’t that too much for a 21 years old, It seems to me that he is ”the SUPERMAN” of AI engineering, hope he takes some days off…</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Along with his new team at GLAMOR Lab with co-workers that he befriended at Google like:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Michael Galkin</strong> Senior Research Scientist at Google | Graph Learning & LLMs</li>
                <li><strong>Jure Leskovec</strong> Professor at Stanford Computer Science and Co-Founder at Kumo.ai</li>
                <li><strong>Loubna Ben Allal</strong> Research Engineer & SmolLM Lead @HuggingFace</li>
                <li><strong>Sophia Yang</strong> Head of Developer Relations @ Mistral AI</li>
            </ul>
            <blockquote>
                <em>That’s just a crazy team composition, full of “final bosses“ which elevate Mann’s real world personality and Network to a whole another level, straight to the moon.<br>
                Oh, Bill Gates or Elon Musk gathers a dream team of the best AI developers, then don’t look far, Mann already is part of that team.</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                And that is <strong>Mann Patel</strong> a young man, with dark hair and a warm, friendly smile with a relaxed, approachable, and enthusiastic personality.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am truly invested to see what Mann is on for his future, and I really want to see when the projects go up what kind of approach would he have in managing all the stuff that he is already in, would he sell some of his projects? Would he get more invested in one than another?
            </p>
            <h3>I think that he will be just fine.</h3>
            <blockquote>
                <em>What 21 years old there is that does the crazy stuff that Mann Patel does anyway?</em>
